Enable SSH on the Steam Deck # SSH (Secure Shell) allows secure remote access to the Steam Deck from another machine, such as your Windows PC.\nStep 1: Power on your Steam Deck and access the desktop mode by pressing the Steam button, selecting \u0026ldquo;Power,\u0026rdquo; and then \u0026ldquo;Switch to Desktop.\u0026rdquo; Step 2: Open a terminal window. You can find the terminal in the applications menu. Step 3: Install the SSH server if it’s not already installed by typing the following command: sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install openssh-server Step 4: Enable and start the SSH service: sudo systemctl enable ssh sudo systemctl start ssh Step 5: Find your Steam Deck’s IP address by typing: ifconfig Look for the inet address under the network interface you\u0026rsquo;re using (e.g., wlan0 for Wi-Fi). 2. Obtain the Patched Files and Apply the Patch on the Windows Machine # Step 1: Download the patch files from the official source or the trusted site where the patch is available. Step 2: Apply the patch to the game files on your Windows machine. This usually involves extracting the patch files and copying them over the existing game files in the installation directory. Step 3: Locate the path of the patched game files on your Windows machine. This is typically in a directory like C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\ followed by the game\u0026rsquo;s name. 3. Create a Tar Archive of the Game Files # Creating a tar archive consolidates many files into one, making it easier and faster to transfer.\nStep 1: Open a terminal or command prompt on your Windows machine. Step 2: Navigate to the directory containing the game files: cd \u0026#34;C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\YourGameName\u0026#34; Step 3: Use a tool like 7-Zip to create a tar archive. If 7-Zip is installed, the command would look like: 7z a -ttar gamefiles.tar * 4. Use SCP to Copy the Tar Archive File to the Steam Deck # SCP (Secure Copy Protocol) allows you to securely transfer files between machines.\nStep 1: Open a terminal or command prompt on your Windows machine. Step 2: Use an SCP client like WinSCP or the scp command if you have an SSH client installed. The command looks like this: scp path\\to\\gamefiles.tar username@steamdeck_ip_address:/home/deck/ Replace path\\to\\gamefiles.tar with the actual path to your tar file, username with the username on your Steam Deck (usually deck), and steamdeck_ip_address with the IP address you found earlier. 5. Replace the Original Game Files on the Steam Deck # Step 1: SSH into your Steam Deck from your Windows machine using a terminal or SSH client: ssh username@steamdeck_ip_address Step 2: Navigate to the directory where the tar file was copied: cd /home/deck/ Step 3: Locate the game files on the Steam Deck. Typically, the path would be something like /home/deck/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/YourGameName. Step 4: Extract the tar archive to replace the original game files: tar -xf gamefiles.tar -C /home/deck/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/YourGameName --strip-components=1 The --strip-components=1 option removes the first part of the path in the tar archive, ensuring that the files are extracted directly into the game directory. Final Steps # Step 1: Ensure that the game files have been replaced correctly. Step 2: Launch the game from the Steam Deck to verify that the patch has been applied successfully. By following these steps, you should be able to apply the game patch on your Steam Deck efficiently.\n","date":"12 June 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/apply-game-patch-on-streamdeck/","section":"Posts","summary":"It is quite painful to apply a game patch on Streamdeck.","title":"Apply Game Patch on Streamdeck","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"12 June 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"12 June 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Sheepy","summary":"","title":"Sheepy","type":"page"},{"content":" Introduction # This is bold text, and this is emphasized text.\nVisit the Hugo website!\n","date":"12 June 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/my-first-post/","section":"Posts","summary":"Introduction # This is bold text, and this is emphasized text.","title":"My First Post","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"}]
